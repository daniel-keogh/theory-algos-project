Y4S2 Theory of Algorithms Project

## Description

A C program that calculates the SHA512 digest of a given input file.

## Compilation

You can compile and run the program as follows:

```sh
$ make
$ ./sha512 FILE [options]
```

### Testing

```sh
$ make test
```

## What is SHA-512?

## Q & A

**_Why can't we reverse the SHA512 algorithm to retrieve the original message from a hash digest?_**

**_Can you design an algorithm that, given enough time, will find input messages that give each of the possible 512-bit strings?_**

**_How difficult is it to find a hash digest beginning with at least twelve zeros?_**
